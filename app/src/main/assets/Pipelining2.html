 <h2>Executing MIPS instructions in parallel</h2>
 Imagine you and three friends need to make several salads for a pot-luck.  In order to make a salad, 4 things must be done:
 <ol>
    <li>
        Find and read a salad recipe.
    </li>
    <li>
        Retrieve the ingredients from the cupboard.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mix the ingredients
    </li>
    <li>
        Put the ingredients away and put the salad in the fridge.
    </li>
</ol>
You only have 1 smartphone to find the recipes, and you can only fit one set of ingredients on the table at the same time.  Also, each step takes 5 minutes.<br>
If you were alone, you could do one action at a time, and it would take you 20 minutes to make each salad. But you have friends!  You can have one friend do each action. It would still take 20 minutes to make a salad from start to finish, but once you made four salads, you would be finishing a salad every 5 minutes, and the overall time to make all the salads would be significantly less than 20 minutes per salad.<br><br>
This is <em>exactly</em> how pipelining works. Finding and reading a recipe is analogous to fetching and decoding an instruction (IM),  retrieving the ingredients is analogous to reading registers (Reg1), mixing the ingredients is analogous to ALU operations, and putting back the ingredients and storing the salad is analogous to memory access (DM).<br><br>
 Consider the following execution of 3 instructions, where time moves from left to write: <br>
 <table><tr><td>add $t0, $t1, $t2</td><td rowspan = "3">
    <table id = "pipeline" cellspacing = "0" cellpadding = "0" onclick = "movePipeline('pipeline', -1, -1, -1, -1)"></table>
    </td></tr>
    <tr><td>sub $t1, $t1, $t2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>beq $t4, $t5, Loop</td></tr>
 </table><br>
 Notice how resources can be shared among the instructions during different cycles.  For example, the ALU operates at a different time for each instruction, thus, there is never an issue where two instructions need to use the ALU at the same time. From the salad analogy, this is the same as how one person can be mixing a salad together all the time, switching which salad they are mixing every 5 minutes.<br><br>
 This is significantly more efficient than executing instruction one at a time: now, the effective CPI is 1, rather than 5.  However, it still takes 5 cycles to get a result once you start executing an instruction.<br><br>
 
 <h2>Can this be hazardous?</h2>
 But what would happen if, while salad making, more than one recipe needed the same ingredient.  What if your friends could not communicate with each other, so when one of them tries to retrieve the shared ingredient and cannot find it, they will keep looking in the cupboard until the ingredient is returned to the cupboard.  It's going to be 10 minutes until the shared ingredient is returned to the cupboard! Thank goodness you can communicate with your friends!<br><br>
 
 But without adding many extra parts, the stages of the pipeline cannot communicate with each other like you and your friends can.  Consider the following set of instructions:<br>
 <table><tr><td>add $t0, $t0, $t2</td><td rowspan = "3">
    <table id = "pipeline2" cellspacing = "0" cellpadding = "0" onclick = "movePipeline('pipeline2', 3, 0, 2, 1)"></table>
    </td></tr>
    <tr><td>sub $t0, $t0, $t3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>beq $t4, $t3, Loop</td></tr>
 </table><br>
 Notice how the result of the first instruction is stored into $t0, and the second instruction reads from $t0.  However, in the pipeline, the result from the first instruction is stored into $t0 <em>after</em> the second instruction reads from $t0.  This is a problem!  The value read in the second instruction will be $t0 before $t2 is added to it!  This is called a <strong>hazard</strong>.
