<h2  id = "startText">MIPS Pipline</h2>
<span>Each MIPS instruction is generally implemented in 3 steps:</span>
<ul>
    <li> Instruction Fetch: Fetch the instruction at the Program Counter address.</li>
    <li> Decode: Decode the instruction.</li>
    <li> Execute: Execute the instruction </li>
</ul>
Obviously, the actions taken in order to execute the instruction varies greatly between instructions.
Potential actions include:
<ul>
    <li>Reading from registers</li>
    <li>Writing to registers</li>
    <li>Doing arithmetic operations on registers</li>
    <li>Reading memory from a memory address stored in a register</li>
    <li>Writing the value of a register to a memory address stored in a register</li>
    <li>Performing sign extensions</li>
</ul>
Each of these actions use specific resources, and often need to be performed in a specific order to fulfill the instruction.  Specifying the order in which these actions must occur is called <strong>designing a pipeline</strong>. <br>
There are several possible pipeline designs for any given set of instructions; it is important to choose one that makes logical sense, and minimizes <strong>hazards</strong> (which we will discuss later).  A simple example of a not-working pipeline would be one where ALU operations happen before reading from a register - how will the ALU know what numbers to operate on?<br><br>

The MIPS Architecture has the following Pipeline:<br>
<table cellspacing = "0" cellpadding = "0"  id = "simplePipeline" onclick = "movePipeline('simplePipeline', -1, -1, -1, -1)"></table>
<ol>
    <li>
    First, instructions are read and decoded, and the PC is updated, in the <strong>IM</strong> stage.
    </li>
    <li>
    Then, the necessary registers are read from in the <strong>Reg1</strong> stage.  Registers may need to be read from for performing arithmetic operations on, or for writing their values for memory.  At this stage, offsets are also sign extended - since offsets are immediates, they are less than 32-bits, so they must be extended to be 32-bit numbers in MIPS.
    </li>
    <li>
    In the <strong>ALU</strong> stage, any necessary arithmetic operations happen.  This includes:
    <ul>
        <li>Arithmetic for arithmetic instructions (add, sub, etc)</li>
        <li>Calculating a memory address for lw or sw: the offset must be added to the base address</li>
        <li>Branch comparison: Using the zero flag of the ALU, numbers can be compared for branching instructions</li>
    </ul>
    After the ALU stage, Branch and jump instructions are completed.
    </li>
    <li>
    In the <strong>Memory Access</strong> stage, memory is read from or written to (lw or sw instructions).  For non-lw and non-sw instructions, the result of the ALU stage is written to a register.  At this point, R-type instructions and memory write (sw) instructions are completed.
    </li>
    <li>
    Finally, at the <strong>Write Back</strong> stage of the pipeline, values read from memory (lw) are written to a register.
    </li>
</ol>
Some instruction-pipeline examples:<br>
<ol>
    <strong>add $a, $b, $c</strong>
    <li>
    IM: First, the instruction is decoded, so that we know we must read from $b and $c, add the contents, and store the result into $a.
    </li>
    <li>
    Reg1: We read the values at $b and $c.
    </li>
    <li>
    ALU: We add the values at $b and $c.
    </li>
    <li>
    DM: We write the result from the ALU stage into $a.
    </li>
    <li>
    Reg2: Do nothing - add does not use the Reg2 part of the stage.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <strong>lw $a, offset($b)</strong>
    <li>
    IM: First, the instruction is decoded, so that we know we must calculate a memory address, read from it, and store its value into $a.
    </li>
    <li>
    Reg1: We read the register value at $b.  We also sign extend the offset.
    </li>
    <li>
    ALU: We add the sign-extended offset to the value at $b.  The result is the address we want in memory.
    </li>
    <li>
    DM: We read the memory at address $b + offset.
    </li>
    <li>
    Reg2: We write the value at $b + offset to $a.
    </li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <strong>beq $a, $b, Loop</strong>
    <li>
    IM: First, the instruction is decoded, so that we know we must compare $a and $b, and potentially change PC to Loop.
    </li>
    <li>
    Reg1: We read the register values at $a and $b.
    </li>
    <li>
    ALU: We subtract $a from $b.  If the zero flag is set, that means $a and $b are equal, and we update PC to the value Loop.  This instruction is now complete.
    </li>
    <li>
    DM: Nothing.
    </li>
    <li>
    Reg2: Nothing.
    </li>
</ol>

<ol>
    <strong>j Loop</strong>
    <li>
    IM: First, the instruction is decoded, so that we know we must load Loop into the PC counter.
    </li>
    <li>
    Reg1: The value Loop, which is translated to be a memory address by the compiler, is loaded into PC, and the instruction is done.
    </li>
    <li>
    ALU: Nothing.
    </li>
    <li>
    DM: Nothing.
    </li>
    <li>
    Reg2: Nothing.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Simple, right?</h2>
The process for executing one instruction at a time using the MIPS pipeline is pretty simple.  Each stage takes 1 CPU cycle, so, obviously the length of 1 CPU cycle must be the longest time it takes for one stage.  Therefore, each instruction takes 3-5 cycles.
<h2>Now what?</h2>
At this rate, the pipeline is executing 1 instruction for every 5 cycles.  But notice, each cycle uses specific resources that generally do not overlap with each other.  For example, the ALU is used a maximum of one time in while executing one instruction.  Why can't multiple instructions share the ALU?  Well, they can!<br>
