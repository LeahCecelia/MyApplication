<h2 id = "startText">Structural Hazards</h1>

<p>When a machine is pipelined, the overlapped execution of instructions requires duplication of resources accessed by these instruction stages to allow all possible combinations of instructions in the pipeline.
If some combination of instructions cannot be accommodated because of a resource conflict, the machine is said to have a structural hazard.
</p>
<p>Common instances of structural hazards arise when some resource has not been duplicated enough to allow all combinations of instructions in the pipeline to execute.</p>
<p>Below is an example where multiple instructions try to use the memory during the same cycle: </p>

    <table><tr><td>load </td><td rowspan = "5">
        <table id = "pipeline" cellspacing = "0" cellpadding = "0" onclick = "movePipeline('pipeline', 3, 0, 3, 3)"></table>
    </td></tr>
        <tr><td>instr 1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>instr 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>instr 3</td></tr>

    </table>
    <p>
        The above causes a hazard so we will fix this by stalling the pipeline for a cycle
    </p>
    <table><tr><td>load </td><td rowspan = "5">
        <table id = "pipeline2" cellspacing = "0" cellpadding = "0" onclick = "movePipeline('pipeline2', 3, 0, 4, 4)"></table>
    </td></tr>
        <tr><td>instr 1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>instr 2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>stall</td></tr>
        <tr><td>instr 3</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Stalling reduces the CPI, so by having multiple instances of the memory resource, both instructions can access memory in the same cycle
    as seen in the MIPS control path with hazards.</p>
