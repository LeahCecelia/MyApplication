EECS 314 Android project

We developed this application in Android Studio.  To import the project to Android Studio, all you should have to do is unzip the project file into you Android Studio projects folder, and then open the directory in Android Studio.  This strategy worked pretty well for us, but you may need to clean the project in Android Studio before it runs.

An important thing to note is that some parts of our app is written in HTML/Javascript/JQuery/CSS, and this material can be accessed in your web browser without having to run the android emulator.  If you would like to do this, go to the folder MyApplication/app/src/main/assets.  Open MipsReference.html to see the MIPS Reference sheet page, and the Pipelining.html page to see the Pipelining tool (navigation is provided to go to the multiple pipelining pages).  If you make your web browser thin, this is a pretty good approximation of what the app would look like on a smaller device.
